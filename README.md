# AM Parts Density Prediction - Data Science Approach

## Overview
I developed a comprehensive machine learning pipeline to predict the density of Additive Manufacturing (AM) parts. This document outlines our data-driven approach, detailing each stage of the pipeline from data preprocessing to model training and evaluation.

## Pipeline Stages

### 1. Data Preprocessing (`data_preprocessor.py`)
   - **Loading Data**: The data is loaded from an `.xlsm` file.
   - **Descriptive Analysis**: We provide a statistical description of the dataset.
   - **Handling Missing Values**: Any missing values in the dataset are filled with the mean value of the respective column.
   - **Normalization**: Specific columns are normalized using Min-Max Scaling to ensure uniformity in data.

### 2. Feature Selection (`feature_selector.py`)
   - **Correlation Heatmap**: Generates a heatmap to visualize the correlation between features, including the target variable.
   - **Feature Importance Analysis**: Utilizes `RandomForestRegressor` to determine the importance of each feature.
   - **Recursive Feature Elimination**: Applies RFE to select the top features that contribute the most to the target variable prediction.

### 3. Model Training and Evaluation (`ml_trainer.py`, `ml_evaluator.py`)
   - **Model Registry**: Registers various models for training.
   - **Model Training**: Trains models like `RandomForestRegressor`, `LinearRegression`, and `Lasso` on the training dataset.
   - **Performance Evaluation**: Evaluates the models using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (RÂ²) on both training and validation datasets.

### 4. Model Prediction (`ml_predictor.py`)
   - **Model Prediction**: Makes predictions on the test dataset.
   - **Performance Evaluation**: Evaluates the final model's performance on the test dataset.
   - **Confidence Interval Calculation**: For RandomForest, calculates confidence intervals for the predictions.

### Feature Importance Analysis

The following table represents the importance of each feature as determined by the `RandomForestRegressor`. The importance is calculated by how much each feature contributes to the improvement of the model's predictions. The higher the value, the more important the predictor.

| Feature               | Importance |
|-----------------------|------------|
| Laser Power           | 0.454423   |
| Laser Speed           | 0.254031   |
| Hatch Distance        | 0.121952   |
| Gas flow rate in m/s  | 0.103303   |
| Y_coord               | 0.053498   |
| X_coord               | 0.012794   |

*Table 1: Feature Importance Scores from RandomForestRegressor*


These importance scores are computed by fitting a RandomForestRegressor with a specified number of trees (`n_estimators`). Each feature's importance score is the sum of the decrease in error when the feature is used for splitting, averaged over all trees. The values are then normalized to sum to one. This analysis is crucial for understanding which features have the most predictive power for the density of AM parts.


### Feature Selection Justification

The selection of features is a crucial step that affects the performance of the predictive model. The decisions are made by analyzing the importance scores, the correlation of features with the target variable 'Total density', and the independence between features to mitigate multicollinearity.

#### Criteria for Selection:

- **Statistical Significance**: Features with higher importance scores are indicative of a greater impact on model accuracy and are therefore emphasized.
- **Correlation with Target**: Features that show a significant correlation with 'Total density' are likely to have better predictive power.
- **Independent Features**: It is crucial to select features that exhibit low inter-feature correlation to prevent multicollinearity, which can affect model stability and interpretability.

#### Detailed Performance Analysis of Selected Features:

- `Laser Power` (Importance: 0.454423) stands out as the most significant predictor. The distribution plot shows a wide spread, indicating diverse data points that the model can learn from. The correlation heatmap suggests that this feature is not highly correlated with others, underlining its unique contribution to the model.

- `Laser Speed` (Importance: 0.254031) is also highly regarded due to its substantial variability observed in the distribution plot, which is a desirable attribute for a predictive feature. The correlation heatmap reveals that it has a moderate positive relationship with the target variable, reinforcing its selection.

- `Hatch Distance` (Importance: 0.121952) is included based on its moderate importance score and its distribution which, although less varied than 'Laser Power' and 'Laser Speed', still provides a decent amount of information. The heatmap indicates a negative correlation with 'Gas flow rate in m/s', suggesting that it captures different aspects of the data.

- `Gas flow rate in m/s` (Importance: 0.103303) is chosen due to its notable contribution to model predictions and its distinctive distribution, as seen in the histograms. Despite some level of correlation with 'Hatch Distance', its unique variance justifies its inclusion.

The selection of these features is expected to yield a model that accurately predicts 'Total density' while maintaining a balance between complexity and interpretability.
