# AM Parts Density Prediction - Machine Learning Approach

## Overview
I developed a comprehensive machine learning pipeline to predict the density of Additive Manufacturing (AM) parts. This document outlines our data-driven approach, detailing each stage of the pipeline from data preprocessing to model training and evaluation.

## Pipeline Stages

### 1. Data Preprocessing (`data_preprocessor.py`)
   - **Loading Data**: The data is loaded from an `.xlsm` file.
   - **Descriptive Analysis**: We provide a statistical description of the dataset.
   - **Handling Missing Values**: Any missing values in the dataset are filled with the mean value of the respective column.
   - **Normalization**: Specific columns are normalized using Min-Max Scaling to ensure uniformity in data.

### 2. Feature Selection (`feature_selector.py`)
   - **Correlation Heatmap**: Generates a heatmap to visualize the correlation between features, including the target variable.
   - **Feature Importance Analysis**: Utilizes `RandomForestRegressor` to determine the importance of each feature.
   - **Recursive Feature Elimination**: Applies RFE to select the top features that contribute the most to the target variable prediction.

### 3. Model Training and Evaluation (`ml_trainer.py`, `ml_evaluator.py`)
   - **Model Registry**: Registers various models for training.
   - **Model Training**: Trains models like `RandomForestRegressor`, `LinearRegression`, and `Lasso` on the training dataset.
   - **Performance Evaluation**: Evaluates the models using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (RÂ²) on both training and validation datasets.

### 4. Model Prediction (`ml_predictor.py`)
   - **Model Prediction**: Makes predictions on the test dataset.
   - **Performance Evaluation**: Evaluates the final model's performance on the test dataset.
   - **Confidence Interval Calculation**: For RandomForest, calculates confidence intervals for the predictions.


## Conclusion
Our machine learning pipeline offers a systematic and data-driven approach to predict the density of AM parts. Through careful preprocessing, feature selection, and model evaluation, we ensure the accuracy and reliability of our predictions. The choice of the Random Forest model, guided by empirical evidence, stands as a testament to our commitment to leveraging advanced analytics in manufacturing.
